### What is ADHD?
Have you heard of ADHD? It seems that the number of individuals diagnosed with ADHD has suddenly increased. ADHD is a mental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, impulsive behavior, and hyperactivity. 


### The Raise of the left-handed
I found an interesting analogy in the [video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck9FMtIGVxQ)of [@NoBoilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate). The analogy mentioned that before the 1920s, the number of left-handed individuals was relatively low.

Then, There was a sudden increase in the number of left-handed individuals. However, this rise does not suggest that more people suddenly became left-handed. Instead, society has begun to reduce the stigma surrounding Left-handed individuals. With the reduction of negative attitudes and discrimination, left-handed individuals felt more comfortable openly using their left-hand.

### The Stigma of Left-Handed

There are numerous stigmas associated with being left-handed. In the 18th century, discrimination against left-handed individuals was at its peak. Teachers and parents often punished children for writing with their left hand. During the Industrial Revolution, left-handed people faced additional challenges, as companies would refuse to hire them because most tools and machines were designed exclusively for right-handed workers. Furthermore, in the 20th century, research by Gordon suggested that a significant number of left-handed individuals were more likely to have mental disabilities, further perpetuating negative stereotypes and misconceptions about left-handedness. I believe a similar situation applies to individuals with ADHD. As society has become more accepting, more people now feel comfortable openly acknowledging their condition. That is why I called them left-handed brain.

### The Stigma of the ADHD

The stigma surrounding ADHD is prevalent in our community as well. Many people in the Middle East have little to no knowledge about the disorder, which contributes to misunderstandings and misconceptions. ADHD is often surrounded by various stigmas, such as people claiming, "There never used to be this many individuals with ADHD" or "ADHD was invented just to sell medication." In addition, individuals with ADHD often have to work harder, ADHD is not about a lack of effort; it's about feeling overwhelmed by tasks, which makes managing them significantly more challenging. People with ADHD often struggle with organizing and prioritizing, not because they aren't trying, but because the nature of the disorder makes it harder to process and execute tasks effectively.

### The impact of Stigma on ADHD Individuals

The impact of stigma on individuals with ADHD can be significant, leading to feelings of shame about their condition, which may prevent them from seeking the support and help they need. They may also experience a sense of isolation from society due to misunderstandings or lack of support from others. Additionally, the stigma can lower self-esteem; when individuals with ADHD internalize negative stereotypes, they may begin to believe them, which further weakens their self-confidence.

### Conclusion

The impact of stigma on individuals with ADHD can be profound. Adults with ADHD often experience low self-esteem as they struggle to meet their own expectations and face ongoing challenges with attention, focus, and feelings of being overwhelmed. This stigma worsens these difficulties, making it harder for them to feel confident in their abilities and manage daily tasks effectively.
