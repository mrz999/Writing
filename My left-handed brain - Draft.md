### What is ADHD?

Have you heard of ADHD? It seems that the number of individuals diagnosed with ADHD has suddenly increased. ADHD is a mental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, impulsive behavior, and hyperactivity. 

In GCC societies like ours, mental disorders are often stigmatized, making it difficult for individuals to openly admit their struggles. This reluctance to seek help can have serious consequences, which I will explore further in this article

### What is a Stigma?

A stigma refers to the negative and unfair beliefs held about a group of people, which often lead to discrimination and exclusion. For instance, common stigmas include labeling individuals or groups based on stereotypes, assuming that people with mental health challenges are dangerous, or believing that a person's intelligence is determined by their gender or race.

When a person experiences stigma, it can have profound effects on their mental, emotional, and social well-being. This impact may manifest in various ways, such as experiencing feelings of distress and hopelessness, developing low self-esteem, and avoiding seeking support or help. Individuals facing stigma often struggle to maintain social relationships, encounter challenges in the workplace, and may find it difficult to secure or retain employment. Additionally, social isolation, coupled with the potential for bullying and harassment, further exacerbates the negative impact on their quality of life.

### The Stigma of the ADHD

The stigma surrounding ADHD is prevalent in our community as well. Many people in the GCC have little to no knowledge about the disorder, which contributes to misunderstandings and misconceptions. ADHD is often surrounded by various stigmas, such as people claiming, "There never used to be this many individuals with ADHD" or "ADHD was invented just to sell medication." In addition, "individuals with ADHD often have to work harder". 
ADHD is not about a lack of effort; it's about feeling overwhelmed by tasks, which makes managing them significantly more challenging. People with ADHD often struggle with organizing and prioritizing, not because they aren't trying, but because the nature of the disorder makes it harder to process and execute tasks effectively.

### The Raise of the left-handed

This stigma takes us back to the 1920s, when left-handed individuals faced a similar kind of discrimination. I found an interesting analogy in the [video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck9FMtIGVxQ)of [@NoBoilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate). The analogy mentioned that before the 1920s, the number of left-handed individuals was relatively low.

Then, There was a sudden increase in the number of left-handed individuals. However, this rise does not suggest that more people suddenly became left-handed. Instead, society has begun to reduce the stigma surrounding Left-handed individuals. With the reduction of negative attitudes and discrimination, left-handed individuals felt more comfortable openly using their left-hand.

### The Stigma of Left-Handed

There are numerous stigmas associated with being left-handed. In the 18th century, discrimination against left-handed individuals was at its peak. Teachers and parents often punished children for writing with their left hand. During the Industrial Revolution, left-handed people faced additional challenges, as companies would refuse to hire them because most tools and machines were designed exclusively for right-handed workers. Furthermore, in the 20th century, research by [Gordon](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/43/4/313/271846?redirectedFrom=fulltext) suggested that a significant number of left-handed individuals were more likely to have mental disabilities, further perpetuating negative stereotypes and misconceptions about left-handedness. I believe a similar situation applies to individuals with ADHD. As society has become more accepting, more people now feel comfortable openly acknowledging their condition. That is why I called them left-handed brain.

### Why Left-Handed and ADHD Individuals have similarities ?

Why am I comparing left-handed individuals to those with ADHD? The reason is that both groups experience behaviors that deviate from social norms, leading to judgment and stigma. 

The similarities in how society treats them are striking. For example, in the past, parents and teachers punished left-handed children for using their left hand, just as individuals with ADHD are often labeled as lazy or troublemakers and often get punished for their behavior. 

Many companies, especially industrial ones, avoided hiring left-handed people because their tools and machines were designed for right-handed use, signaling that society wasnâ€™t built with left-handed people in mind. Similarly, the education system often views individuals with ADHD as failures or lazy, when in fact, the system itself is not designed to accommodate their needs.

### The impact of Stigma on ADHD Individuals

The impact of stigma on individuals with ADHD can be significant, leading to feelings of shame about their condition, which may prevent them from seeking the support and help they need. They may also experience a sense of isolation from society due to misunderstandings or lack of support from others. Additionally, the stigma can lower self-esteem; when individuals with ADHD internalize negative stereotypes, they may begin to believe them, which further weakens their self-confidence.

### Conclusion

The impact of stigma on individuals with ADHD can be profound. Adults with ADHD often experience low self-esteem as they struggle to meet their own expectations and face ongoing challenges with attention, focus, and feelings of being overwhelmed. This stigma worsens these difficulties, making it harder for them to feel confident in their abilities and manage daily tasks effectively.

Individuals with ADHD need to understand that they are neither lazy nor failures; their brains simply function differently than the traditional education system is designed for. They should recognize that they have unique needs and ways of thinking, and it's important to seek help and support if they feel their ADHD is becoming overwhelming. There are many tools available that can help manage their daily lives and enhance their productivity.

At the same time, society needs to eliminate the stigma surrounding people with ADHD and give them opportunities to thrive, rather than holding them back with unfair labels. By taking these initial steps, we can create an environment where individuals with ADHD are empowered to be more productive, creative, and successful.
